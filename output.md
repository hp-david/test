<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 45px;"> AI Blueprint Projects for HP AI Studio ðŸš€ </h1>\n\n# Content  \n- [Overview](#overview)\n- [Repository Structure](#repository-structure)\n- [Data Science and Machine Learning](#data-science-and-machine-learning)\n- [Deep Learning](#deep-learning)\n- [Generative AI](#generative-ai)\n- [NVIDIA GPU Cloud](#nvidia-gpu-cloud)\n- [Contact and Support](#contact-and-support)\n\n---\n\n# Overview \n\nThis repository contains a collection of sample projects that you can run quickly and effortlessly, designed to integrate seamlessly with [**Z by HP AI Studio**](https://zdocs.datascience.hp.com/docs/aistudio/overview). Each project runs end-to-end, offering out-of-the-box, ready-to-use solutions across various domains, including data science, machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI.  \n\nThe projects leverage local open-source models such as **LLaMA** (Meta), **BERT** (Google), and **CitriNet** (NVIDIA), alongside selected online models accessible via **Hugging Face**. These examples cover a wide range of use cases, including **data visualization**, **stock analysis**, **audio translation**, **agentic RAG applications**, and much more.  \n\nWe are continuously expanding this collection with new projects. If you have suggestions or would like to see a specific sample project integrated with [**Z by HP AI Studio**](https://zdocs.datascience.hp.com/docs/aistudio/overview), please feel free to open a new issue in this repository â€” we welcome your feedback!\n\n---\n\n# Repository Structure \n\n- data-science-and-machine-learning\n  - covid_movement_patterns_with_var\n  - handwritten_digit_classification_with_keras\n  - iris_flowers_classification_with_svm\n  - recommender_systems_with_tensorflow\n  - spam_detection_with_NLP\n- deep-learning\n  - bert_qa\n  - super_resolution\n  - text_generation\n- generative-ai\n  - agentic_rag_with_trt-llm_and_langgraph\n  - automated_evaluation_with_structured_outputs\n- ngc-integration\n  - audio_translation_with_nemo_models
