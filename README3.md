## Setup

### 0 ‚ñ™ Minimum Hardware Requirements

Ensure your environment meets the minimum compute requirements for smooth performance:

- **RAM**: 16 GB  
- **VRAM**: 4 GB  
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU

### 1 ‚ñ™ Create an AI Studio Project

- Create a new project in [Z by HP AI Studio](https://zdocs.datascience.hp.com/docs/aistudio/overview).

### 2 ‚ñ™ Set Up a Workspace

- Choose **Deep Learning** as the base image.

### 3 ‚ñ™ Clone the Repository

```bash
https://github.com/HPInc/AI-Blueprints.git
```

- Ensure all files are available after workspace creation.

---

## Usage

### 1.1 ‚ñ™ Run the Notebook (Optional):
Run the following notebook `/run-workflow-TF.ipynb`:
1. Obtain Text Data from the shakespeare.txt.
2. Prepare the textual data. It's needed to encode the data to provide the model a proper numerical representation of the text.
3. Create Training Batches for divide the dataset into smaller, manageable groups of data points that are fed into a machine learning model during the training process.
4. Create the GRU Model.
5. Train the model.
- Train the model with the selected epochs.
  
6. Generate the Predictions with the words 'Confidence' and 'Love'. The words can be changed.

### 1.2 ‚ñ™ Run the Notebook (Optional):
Run the following notebook `/run-workflow-Torch.ipynb`:
1. Obtain Text Data from the shakespeare.txt.
2. Prepare the textual data. It's needed to decode and encode the data to give the model a proper numerical representation of the text.
3. One Hot Encoding to convert categorical data into a fixed-size vector of numerical values.
4. Create Training Batches for divide the dataset into smaller, manageable groups of data points that are fed into a machine learning model during the training process.
5. Create the LSTM Model with the decoder and encoder files
6. Train the Network to do the Predictions
7. Generate the Predictions with the words 'Confidence' and 'Love'. The words can be changed.

### Step 2: Deploy the Service  
1. Execute `/register-model.ipynb ` to register the model in MLflow and create the API logic.  
2. Navigate to **Deployments > New Service** in AI Studio.  
3. Name the service and select the registered model.  
4. Choose an available model version and configure it with **GPU acceleration**.  
5. Start the deployment.  
6. Once deployed, click on the **Service URL** to access the Swagger API page.  
7. At the top of the Swagger API page, follow the provided link to open the demo UI for interacting with the locally deployed model.

### 3‚ÄØ‚ñ™‚ÄØSwagger / raw API

Once deployed, access the **Swagger UI** via the Service URL.

Paste a payload like:

```
{
  "inputs": {
    "initial_word": [
      "love"
    ],
    "size": [
      100
    ]
  },
  "params": {}
}

```

And as response:

```
{
  "predictions": "love is\n      an one that was a maider, which it is a more a town\n     on the state, that was the state o"
}

```

### 4 ‚ñ™ Use the HTML Demo

From the Swagger page, click the **‚ÄúDemo‚Äù** link to interact via a simple web form:

* Enter your source text.
* Click **Submit**.
* View the generated text right in the browser.

### Successful UI demo
