# Overview 

This repo contain a collections of sample project you can run quick and effortless, made to works good with [**Z by HP AI Studio**](https://zdocs.datascience.hp.com/docs/aistudio/overview). Each projects runs from end-to-end, and offers out-of-box usable solution across many domain like data science, ML, DL and generative ai.  

Projects uses local open source models like **LLaMA** (meta), **BERT** (google) and **CitriNet** (nvidia), plus some online models via **Hugging Face**. You can try different usecases like **data visual**, **stocks analyse**, **audio translate**, **agent RAG** and more.  

We is adding more examples regularly. If you got suggestion or want to see something specific with [**Z by HP AI Studio**](https://zdocs.datascience.hp.com/docs/aistudio/overview), just open an issue in the repo — feedback are welcome!

# Data Science and machine learning

This samples show how to build data science and ML projects with [**Z by HP AI Studio**](https://zdocs.datascience.hp.com/docs/aistudio/overview).

There is **5 sample project** that is ready to use and help you get start fastly.

### 🌸 Iris Flower Classify with SVM

This project is basic **classify** experiment to predicts type of **Iris flower**.  

It work on **Data Science Workspace**, and show how supervised learning works for many-class problem.

### 🖌️ Handwriting Digit Classify with Keras

This model make simple **image classify** using **TensorFlow**.  

It training model for MNIST digit and needs **Deep Learning Workspace**.
