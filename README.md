# Data Science

The sample projects in this folder demonstrates how to build data science app with [**HP AI Studio**](https://www.hp.com/us-en/workstations/ai-studio.html).

We provides **2 blueprint project**, each designed for quick and easy use too help you get started efficently.

### üå∏ Classification with SVM

This project is a simply **classification** experiment focused on predicting specie of **Iris flowers**.  

It runs on the **Data Science Workspace**, demonstrating basic supervise learn technique for multi-class classification tasks.

### üèôÔ∏è Data Analysis with VAR

This project explores a **regression** experiment using **mobility datas** collected during the COVID-19 pandemics.  

It highlights how city-level movement pattern changed during the crisis. The experiment run on the **Data Science Workspace**.
