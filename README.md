# Overview 

This repository have a collections of example projects that can be runned fast and effortless, and is design for integrate good with [**HP AI Studio**](https://www.hp.com/us-en/workstations/ai-studio.html). Each project runs end-to-end and offers out-of-box and easy-to-use solution for many domain like datascience, ML, deep-learnings and Gen AI.  

The projects is using some local open source model like **LLaMA** (Meta), **BERT** (Google), and **CitriNet** (NVIDIA), also few hosted models from **Hugging Face**. Those example include case like **data visual**, **stock predict**, **voice to text**, **agent rag**, and others more.  

We is always adding new projects. If you got idea or want to see something add to [**HP AI Studio**](https://www.hp.com/us-en/workstations/ai-studio.html), just open new issues on repo ‚Äî we like your feedbacks!

# Data Science

The sample in this folder show how build datascience things with [**HP AI Studio**](https://www.hp.com/us-en/workstations/ai-studio.html).  

We giving 2 blueprint, each made for quick start and use easily.  

### üå∏ Classification with SVM

This project is simple **classification** task about predicting kind of **iris flowers**.  

It run on **Data Science Workspace**, and show basic supervised model for classifying things.

### üèôÔ∏è Data Analysis with VAR

This one doing **regression** experiment with **covid mobility** dataset.  

It tells how cities movement changes during pandemic. Run on **Data Science Workspace** too.
