# NVIDIA GPU Cloud Integration

The sample projects in this folder demostrates how to integrate **NVIDIA NGC (NVIDIA GPU Clouds)** resource with [**HP AI Studio**](https://www.hp.com/us-en/workstations/ai-studio.html).

We provide **5 blueprint project**, each designed for quick and ease use too help you gets started efficiently.

### ü§ñ Agentic RAG with TensorRT-LLM

This project contains a single integrated pipeline ‚Äî Agentic RAG for AI Studio with TRT-LLM and LangGraph ‚Äî that implement a Retrieval-Augment Generation (RAG) workflows using:

TensorRT-backed Llama-3.1-Nano (TRT-LLM): for fast, GPU-accelarated inference.
LangGraph: to orchestrate a agentics, multi step decision flows (relevancy checks, memory lookups, query rewriting, retrievals, answer generation, and memory updating).
ChromaDB: as local vectorstore over Markdown context file (about AI Studio).
SimpleKVMemory: a light weight on-disk key value store to cache query-answer pair.


### üéôÔ∏è Audio Translation with NeMo

This project demonstrate a end-to-end **audio translation pipelines** using **NVIDIA NeMo models**. It take an English audio samples and perform:

1. **Speech-to-Text (STT)** conversion using Citrinet  
2. **Text Translation (TT)** from English to Spanish using NMT  
3. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** synthesis in Spanish using FastPitch and HiFiGAN  

All step are GPU-accelerate, and the full workflows is integrate with **MLflow** for experiment tracking and model registered.


### üìà Data Analysis with cuDF  

In this project, we provides notebooks to comparing the execution times of dataset operation using traditional **Pandas** (CPU) versus **NVIDIA‚Äôs cuDF**, a GPU-accelarated drop-in replace for Pandas. This example is present in two different format:

- **Original Example Notebook**: This version, created by NVIDIA, run the entire evaluation within single notebook. It includes download the data and restart the kernel to activate cuDF extension.

- **Data Analysis Notebooks**: These notebook use preprocessed dataset of varying sizes from **datafabric** folder in AI Studio. The evaluation split across two notebook ‚Äî one using Pandas (CPU) and other using cuDF (GPU) ‚Äî with performance metrics log to **MLflow**.


### üì° Data Visualization with cuDF  

This project is GPU-accelerated, interactive **exploratory data analyzing** dashboard for the [OpenCellID](https://www.opencellid.org/) dataset. It use **Panel** and **cuDF** to deliver lightning fast geospatial analyzing and visualizations.

You can explores cell tower distributions by radios type, operators, countries, and time window ‚Äî rendered live on interactive map with full GPU acceleration.


### üåç Vacation Recommendation with BERT

This project implements a **AI-powered recommend agent** that deliver personalize travel suggest based on user query. 

It leverages the **NVIDIA NeMo Framework** and **BERT embedding** to understand user intents and generated highly relevants, tailored vacation recommedations.
