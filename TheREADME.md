# Overview 

This repo contain a collections of sample project that you can run quickly and effortless, designed to integrate seemlessly with [**HP AI Studio**](https://www.hp.com/us-en/workstations/ai-studio.html). Each project run end-to-end, offering out-the-box, ready-to-used solution across various domain, including data science, machine learning, deep learn, and generative AI.  

The project leverage local open source model such as **LLaMA** (Meta), **BERT** (Google), and **CitriNet** (NVIDIA), alongside selected online models accesible via **Hugging Face**. These example covers a wide ranges of usecase, including **data visualization**, **stock analysis**, **audio translation**, **agentic RAG application**, and much more.  

We are continously expanding this collection with new project. If you have suggestion or would like too see a specifik sample project integrated with [**HP AI Studio**](https://www.hp.com/us-en/workstations/ai-studio.html), please feel free to open a new issue in this repo — we welcomes your feedback!

# Data Science

The sample projects in this folder demonstrates how to build data science app with [**HP AI Studio**](https://www.hp.com/us-en/workstations/ai-studio.html).

We provides **2 blueprint project**, each designed for quick and easy use too help you get started efficently.

### 🌸 Classification with SVM

This project is a simply **classification** experiment focused on predicting specie of **Iris flowers**.  

It runs on the **Data Science Workspace**, demonstrating basic supervise learn technique for multi-class classification tasks.

### 🏙️ Data Analysis with VAR

This project explores a **regression** experiment using **mobility datas** collected during the COVID-19 pandemics.  

It highlights how city-level movement pattern changed during the crisis. The experiment run on the **Data Science Workspace**.
