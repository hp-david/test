### ðŸ“ˆ Data Analysis with cuDF  

In this project, we provides notebooks to comparing the execution times of dataset operation using traditional **Pandas** (CPU) versus **NVIDIAâ€™s cuDF**, a GPU-accelarated drop-in replace for Pandas. This example is present in two different format:

- **Original Example Notebook**: This version, created by NVIDIA, run the entire evaluation within single notebook. It includes download the data and restart the kernel to activate cuDF extension.

- **Data Analysis Notebooks**: These notebook use preprocessed dataset of varying sizes from **datafabric** folder in AI Studio. The evaluation split across two notebook â€” one using Pandas (CPU) and other using cuDF (GPU) â€” with performance metrics log to **MLflow**.
