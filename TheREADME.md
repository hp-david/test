# Deep Learning

The sample projects in this folder demostrates how to built deep learning apps with [**HP AI Studio**](https://www.hp.com/us-en/workstations/ai-studio.html).

We provide **6 blueprint project**, each designed for quick and ease use to help you get start efficiently.


### üñåÔ∏è Classification with Keras

This project performs basics **image classification** using the **TensorFlow** frame work.  

It trains a model to classifies handwrited digits from the **MNIST** dataset and runs on the **Deep Learning Workspace**.


### üß† Question Answering with BERT

This project demonstrate a simple **BERT Question Answer (QA)** experiment. It provides code to train a BERT-based model, as well instructions to load a pretrained model from **Hugging Face**.  

The model is deploy using **MLflow** to expose an inference service capable to answer questions based on input text.


### üé¨ Recommendation System with TensorFlow

This project builds a simple **recommender system** for movie using **TensorFlow**.  

It train on user-item interaction datas to predict movies preference and run on the **Deep Learning Workspace**.


### üö´ Spam Detection with NLP

This project implements a **text classifies** system to detect **spams** messages.  

It use deep learn technique and requires the **Deep Learning Workspace** for train and inferencing.


### üñºÔ∏è Super Resolution with FSRCNN

This project showcase a **Computer Vision** experiment that applys convolutional neural network for **image super-resolution** ‚Äî enhancering the quality and resolution of input image.  


### ‚úçÔ∏è Text Generation with RNN

This project illustrates how to builded a simply **character-by-character text generation** model.  

It trains on a dataset containing **Shakespeare's text**, demonstrating the fundamental of text generation by predicting one characters at time.
